//! Host API: the services the host exposes to plugins.
//!
//! The trait here is the *logical* contract. Both runtimes translate it:
//! - Native plugins receive a C ABI function table (see `native.rs`).
//! - WASM plugins receive host functions registered in the linker (see `wasm.rs`).
//!
//! Keeping one logical contract means a plugin written against it behaves the
//! same on desktop and (later) on Android.
