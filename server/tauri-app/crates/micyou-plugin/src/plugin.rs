//! Unified plugin abstraction.
//!
//! Both runtimes (native cdylib and WASM) implement the same logical plugin
//! contract. A loaded plugin is either a `NativePlugin` or a `WasmPlugin`;
//! callers go through `PluginInstance`, so the audio engine, the bus and the
//! GUI never care which runtime backs a plugin.
