//! MicYou plugin framework.
//!
//! Unified plugin abstraction with a dual runtime:
//! - **Native** plugins: platform cdylibs (`.so` / `.dylib` / `.dll`) loaded
//!   through a versioned C ABI, for real-time DSP and deep system integration.
//! - **WASM** plugins: WebAssembly modules executed in a sandboxed interpreter,
//!   for utilities, UI logic and lightweight processing.
//!
//! The manifest, Host API contract and cross-device message protocol are
//! platform-neutral so the same plugin works on the desktop app, the CLI/TUI
//! and (in a future phase) Android with a different loading implementation.
